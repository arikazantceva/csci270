                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I'm Ari Kazantceva. I am a junior at Lake Forest College, I'm from Russia, and I love domesticated rats! &#128000;<br><br>
                    There are two things that define my academic interests:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Solving problems is fun -- how do I achieve the best outcome given the initial set of restrictions and requirements?</li>
                    <li>I have a love for creation and spending time with my hands and my ideas to make something tangible that did not exist before.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Combining Visual Art and Computer Science just seemed like the perfect combination to fit both of these traits :)</p>
