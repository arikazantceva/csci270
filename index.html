    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm Ari Kazantceva. I am a junior at Lake Forest College, I'm from Russia, and I love domesticated rats! &#128000;<br><br>
        There are two things that define my academic interests:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Solving problems is fun -- how do I achieve the best outcome given the initial set of restrictions and requirements?</li>
        <li>I have a love for creation and spending time with my hands and my ideas to make something tangible that did not exist before.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Combining Visual Art and Computer Science just seemed like the perfect combination to fit both of these traits :)</p>
